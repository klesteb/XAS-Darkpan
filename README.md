XAS - Middleware for Perl
==========================

I have over 30 years in systems administration. During those years, I
have written or help maintain 4 operations environments. Most where on
proprietary platforms that can't be reproduced nor released. This one is 
a generic version of the 6th iteration of the 4th environment. The
first iteration was developed 12 years ago.

The philosophy behind these modules is small discrete components that
communication with well defined interfaces. These are the base modules that 
make up the system. They represent a "best practice" on how to write 
distributed systems in Perl.
